# **Dynamic Priority Queue Simulator**  
This project implements a queue simulator where customer priorities are dynamically adjusted based on configurable rules. It uses C++ and is developed with a focus on code quality and unit testing.

## **How to Build and Run the Project**  

### **Prerequisites:**  
Before starting, make sure you have installed:  
- **CMake** (version 3.10 or higher)  
- **C++ Compiler** (with C++17 support)  
  - Example: `g++`, `clang++`, or equivalent  

### **Steps to Build and Run:**  
1. **Clone the repository (if necessary):**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd PriorityQueueSimulator
   ```

2. **Create the build folder:**  
   ```bash
   mkdir build  
   cd build  
   ```

3. **Configure the project using CMake:**  
   Run the following command to generate the build files:  
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. **Compile the project:**  
   Now, run the `make` command to compile the executable:  
   ```bash
   make
   ```

5. **Run the program:**  
   If the compilation is successful, an executable will be generated. Run the program:  
   ```bash
   ./PriorityQueueSimulator
   ```

   You will see the following output in the terminal:  
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```
